Although I had heard of the so called "single-page applications" (SPA) before, 
it wasn't until I used SoundCloud's website that I discovered its true potential 
and importance in creating an immersive user experience. SoundCloud's single-page 
nature allows the music player to remain undisturbed while the rest of the page 
goes about its business with the user's demands. This feature greatly sets 
the site's responsiveness apart from other similar media sharing/viewing sites 
(i.e. YouTube), where browsing or commenting interrupts playback.

While the continuous music playback is quite impressive, the player's 
playlist system can be greatly improved. Previewing upcoming songs navigates 
you to another page. This could be streamlined by having it be displayed in a 
panel that slides into view on click, and dismisses itself after a second click 
or a action on another part of the page. Users can comment on a particular time 
in a song, but to do so requires moving to the song page. Since the music player 
already has a timeline with playhead and current time displayed, this 
functionality could be added to the player, especially since the "Like" button 
is also present on the player.

Having seen the seamless nature of single-page applications, I believe that 
this demonstrates effectively the power of the web in delivering rich, 
dynamic applications that are not only powerful in functionality but also 
immersive in user experience.
